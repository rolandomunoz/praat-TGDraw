* **Draw tier:** Enter the position of the tiers you will show on your picture.
  If you want to show more than one tier, then separate each of them by a
  comma (e.g. ``2, 1`` or ``1, 3``). The plug-in will insert the tiers in the
  specified order from top to bottom.

* **Show boundaries:** Insert vertical-dotted lines across the spectrogram.
  These lines match the tiers boundaries.

* **Dynamic range (Db):** See the description of the command

* **Shade:** With this option, you can hightlight a section of interest in your
  final picture just by selecting a portion of time in the TextGridEditor.

  area. Multiple selections are also possible, this will be explained later.
