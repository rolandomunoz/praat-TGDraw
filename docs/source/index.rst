Welcome to TextGrid PicMaker's documentation!
=============================================

`TextGrid PicMaker` is a Praat plug-in designed to create some default pictures
that combines ``Spectrogram`` and/or ``Pitch`` objects along with ``TextGrid``.

This plug-in also comes with some selecting-viewport mechanisms that will save
you time when creating a picture manually, especially when putting objects
together.

Examples
